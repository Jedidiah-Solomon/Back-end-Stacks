/* 


The window object is specific to web browsers and is not available in a Node.js environment. Since you are running this code using Node.js, you should use a different approach for user input.

Hereâ€™s an alternative way to get user input using the readline-sync package, which works in a Node.js environment:

First, make sure you have the readline-sync package installed. If not, install it using npm:
npm install readline-sync

Modify your code as follows:

const readlinejed = require('readline-sync');

const minNum = 1;
const maxNum = 100;
const answer = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxNum - minNum + 1)) + minNum;
console.log("The answer is:", answer);

let attempts = 0;
let guess;
let running = true;

while (running) {
    guess = parseInt(readlinejed.question(`Guess a number between ${minNum} and ${maxNum}: `));

    if (isNaN(guess)) {
        console.log("Please enter a valid number.");
    } else if (guess < minNum || guess > maxNum) {
        console.log(`Please enter a number between ${minNum} and ${maxNum}.`);
    } else {
        attempts++;
        if (guess === answer) {
            console.log(`Congratulations! You guessed the number ${answer} correctly in ${attempts} attempts.`);
            running = false;
        } else if (guess < answer) {
            console.log("Too low! Try again.");
        } else {
            console.log("Too high! Try again.");
        }
    }
}



or use 

const minNum = 1;
        const maxNum = 100;
        const answer = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxNum - minNum + 1)) + minNum;
        console.log("The answer is:", answer);

        let attempts = 0;
        let guess;
        let running = true;

        while (running) {
            guess = parseInt(window.prompt(`Guess a number between ${minNum} and ${maxNum}:`));

            if (isNaN(guess)) {
                console.log("Please enter a valid number.");
            } else if (guess < minNum || guess > maxNum) {
                console.log(`Please enter a number between ${minNum} and ${maxNum}.`);
            } else {
                attempts++;
                if (guess === answer) {
                    console.log(`Congratulations! You guessed the number ${answer} correctly in ${attempts} attempts.`);
                    running = false;
                } else if (guess < answer) {
                    console.log("Too low! Try again.");
                } else {
                    console.log("Too high! Try again.");
                }
            }
        }

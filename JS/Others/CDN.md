# CDN

```
    A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

    The popularity of CDN services continues to grow, and today the majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon.
    A properly configured CDN may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.

    Is a CDN the same as a web host?
    While a CDN does not host content and can’t replace the need for proper web hosting, it does help cache content at the network edge, which improves website performance. Many websites struggle to have their performance needs met by traditional hosting services, which is why they opt for CDNs.

    By utilizing caching to reduce hosting bandwidth, helping to prevent interruptions in service, and improving security, CDNs are a popular choice to relieve some of the major pain points that come with traditional web hosting.

### What is caching?

```
        Caches store copies of files in order to deliver them more quickly where they are needed.

        A cookie is a file that stores information that identifies an entity. Meanwhile, caching saves parts of a website in order to help it load faster on your next visit. The main purpose of an HTTP cookie and web cache are to enhance the user experience and streamline the webpage loading process.

        JSDelivr is a free public CDN for open-source projects. It can serve web files directly from the npm registry and GitHub repositories without any configuration. Unpkg is a content delivery network for everything on npm.

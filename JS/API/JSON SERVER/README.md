# How to Set up JSON Server in an Application

You'll need Node.js and npm installed on your system, as they're both prerequisites for this setup.

Follow these steps to set up and use JSON Server in your frontend application:

Step #1 - Install JSON Server
To install JSON Server in your application, navigate to your project directory in your terminal or command prompt and type in this command: npm install -g json-server.

This will install the JSON server globally on your system. If you want to install it locally for just a particular project instead, use this command: npm i json-server.

Step #2 - Create a JSON File
Create a JSON file in your project directory that will act as the data source. This JSON file should have a .json file extension. What do I mean? Let's say you want your JSON file name to be 'db', it means you'll create a file called db.json.

Step #3 - Create Data
Define your data inside the JSON file. This JSON data can be an array of objects or an object with nested objects. Each object represents a data entity and should each have a unique id.

Step #4 - Start the Server
Start up the JSON Server by typing this command into your terminal: json-server --watch db.json. This will run on "https://localhost:3000" by default. You can change the port it's running on by specifying a different port number when starting the server using the --port flag.

For example, if you want your server to run on port 8000 instead of the default (3000), use this command while starting the server: json-server --watch db.json --port 8000. You can then view this in your browser on port 8000.

JSON Server will automatically generate RESTful endpoints based on the data you defined in your JSON file.

If you have a JSON file with an array of "users", this is the endpoint that will be automatically generated by the JSON Server:

GET /users - This retrieves a list of all resource entities of users.
GET /users/:id - This retrieves a specific user by its id.
POST /users - This creates a new user.
PUT /users/:id - This updates a user based on a specified id.
DELETE /users/:id - This deletes a user based on the specified id.
This pattern makes it easy to interact with the mock API in a RESTful manner just like one would do with a real backend API.

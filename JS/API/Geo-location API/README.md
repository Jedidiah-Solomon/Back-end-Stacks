# Geolocation API

**The HTML Geolocation API is used to locate a user's position.**

1. Note: Geolocation is most accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones.
2. The getCurrentPosition() method is used to return the user's position.
3. watchPosition() - Returns the current position of the user and continues to return updated position as the user moves (like the GPS in a car).
4. clearWatch() - Stops the watchPosition() method.

```
When you use watchPosition() in the Geolocation API, it starts continuously monitoring the user's position and invokes the provided callback function (showPosition() in this case) whenever the position changes. This is useful if you want to track the user's movement over time or provide real-time updates about their location.

However, the watchPosition() function returns a unique identifier called a "watch ID". This ID is essential because it allows you to stop watching the user's position later on using the clearWatch() function.

Here's why using the watch ID is important:

Control Over Monitoring: By storing the watch ID, you gain control over when to start or stop monitoring the user's position. This is particularly useful if you want to provide a way for the user to opt in or out of location tracking.

Efficient Resource Management: Continuous monitoring of the user's position consumes device resources, such as battery life and network bandwidth. By having the watch ID, you can stop the monitoring when it's no longer needed, thus conserving resources.

Clearing the Watch: If you don't clear the watch when it's no longer necessary (for example, when the user navigates away from a page or no longer wants to be tracked), the browser will continue to monitor the position, potentially wasting resources and impacting performance. Clearing the watch using clearWatch() with the watch ID ensures that monitoring stops when it should.

In this code, storing the watch ID allows you to stop monitoring the user's position when needed, for example, when the user explicitly requests to stop tracking or when they navigate away from the page. This ensures efficient use of resources and provides better control over location tracking functionality.

stopWatching() provides a convenient way to stop monitoring the user's position by calling clearWatch() with the appropriate watch ID obtained when starting the geolocation watch. This function ensures that location tracking can be halted when necessary, helping conserve device resources and providing better control over the application's behavior.

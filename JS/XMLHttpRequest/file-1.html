      /*
                In the context of web development and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), a header refers to 
                the additional information sent along with a request or response. Headers consist of 
                key-value pairs that convey metadata about the request or response and can influence how the data 
                is processed or interpreted by the server or client.

                Headers are categorized into two main types: request headers and response headers.

                Request Headers:
                Request headers are sent by the client (e.g., a web browser) to the server along with an HTTP 
                request.
                These headers provide information about the request itself, such as the type of request, 
                the content type of the data being sent, authentication credentials, caching directives, and more.
                Examples of request headers include Content-Type, Authorization, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, and
                Referer.

                Response Headers:
                Response headers are sent by the server back to the client in response to an HTTP request.
                They provide information about the server's response, such as the content type of the data being 
                sent, the server software, caching directives, and more.
                Examples of response headers include Content-Type, Cache-Control, Server, Set-Cookie, and Content-Length.

                Headers are essential for controlling and configuring the behavior of HTTP transactions. 
                They allow clients and servers to communicate additional information beyond the main request or response
                data. Modern web development often involves manipulating headers to control caching, 
                manage authentication, handle cross-origin requests (CORS), and optimize performance.

                The getResponseHeader() method in JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest object is used to retrieve the value of a specific header from the response received after making an HTTP request. It allows you to access the value of a particular header sent by the server in the response.

                Here's how you can use getResponseHeader():

                const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
                xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data', true);
                xhr.send();

                xhr.onload = function() {
                const contentType = xhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Type');
                console.log('Content-Type header:', contentType);
                };

                e.g Content-Type header: text/plain

                <!DOCTYPE html>

<body>

<h2>The XMLHttpRequest Object</h2>

<div id="demo">
  <p>Let AJAX change this text.</p>
  <button type="button" onclick="loadDoc()">Change Content</button>
</div>

<script>
function loadDoc() {
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('GET', 'https://www.w3schools.com/js/ajax_info.txt', true);
  xhr.send();

  xhr.onload = function() {
    const contentType = xhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Type');
    console.log('Content-Type header:', contentType);
  };
}/////


The Content-Type header specifies the media type (or MIME type) of the content sent in the HTTP response. It informs the client (such as a web browser or XMLHttpRequest) about the type of data that is being returned by the server. Common Content-Type values include:

text/plain: Indicates plain text content without any specific formatting or structure.
text/html: Denotes HTML content, typically used for web pages.
application/json: Indicates JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) content.
application/xml or text/xml: Denotes XML (eXtensible Markup Language) content.
image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif: Specifies image data in JPEG, PNG, or GIF formats.
audio/mpeg, audio/wav: Specifies audio data in MPEG or WAV formats.
video/mp4, video/webm: Specifies video data in MP4 or WebM formats.
These are just a few examples. The Content-Type header is crucial for the client to interpret the response correctly. For instance, if the Content-Type is application/json, the client (such as JavaScript code using XMLHttpRequest) will know that the response body contains JSON data and can parse it accordingly.

In the code example, xhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Type') retrieves the Content-Type header value from the response sent by the server. This information can be used to determine how to handle or process the response data based on its type.

the getAllResponseHeaders() method in JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest object returns all the response headers as a single string. Each header is represented as a key-value pair separated by a colon (:) and a newline character (\r\n).

Here's how it works:

When an XMLHttpRequest is made and a response is received from the server, you can use getAllResponseHeaders() to access all the headers returned in the response.
The method returns a string that contains all the response headers in the format: header1: value1\r\nheader2: value2\r\n...
You can then parse this string to extract individual headers and their corresponding values.
Here's an example of how you might use getAllResponseHeaders():


const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data', true);
xhr.send();

xhr.onload = function() {
  const allHeaders = xhr.getAllResponseHeaders();
  console.log('All response headers:', allHeaders);

  // Parse the headers string to extract specific headers if needed
  const headersArray = allHeaders.split('\r\n');
  const headersObject = {};
  headersArray.forEach(header => {
    const [key, value] = header.split(': ');
    if (key && value) {
      headersObject[key] = value;
    }
  });

  console.log('Parsed headers object:', headersObject);
};/////

the send() is used 

1. For GET requests:
When making a GET request, you generally don't need to send a body with the request (i.e., you're not sending data to the server in the request body). Therefore, you can simply call xhr.send() without any arguments. This method will initiate the GET request to the server.
e.g 
xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data', true);
xhr.send(); // Send a GET request to retrieve data

2. For POST requests:
When making a POST request, you typically send data to the server in the request body. In this case, you use xhr.send(string) to send the specified string as the request body. This could be JSON, form data, or any other format that the server expects for processing.
e.g 
xhr.open('POST', 'https://api.example.com/submit', true);
const data = JSON.stringify({ key: 'value' });
xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
xhr.send(data); // Send a POST request with data in the request body

HTTP Status Messages
HTML Error Messages
When a browser requests a service from a web server, an error might occur, and the server might return an error code like "404 Not Found".

It is common to name these errors HTML error messages.

But these messages are something called HTTP status messages. In fact, the server always returns a message for every request. The most common message is 200 OK.

Below is a list of HTTP status messages that might be returned:

1xx: Information
Message:	Description:
100 Continue	The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body
101 Switching Protocols	The requester has asked the server to switch protocols
103 Early Hints	Used with the Link header to allow the browser to start preloading resources while the server prepares a response

2xx: Successful
Message:	Description:
200 OK	The request is OK (this is the standard response for successful HTTP requests)
201 Created	The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource is created 
202 Accepted	The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed
203 Non-Authoritative Information	The request has been successfully processed, but is returning information that may be from another source
204 No Content	The request has been successfully processed, but is not returning any content
205 Reset Content	The request has been successfully processed, but is not returning any content, and requires that the requester reset the document view

206 Partial Content	The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client
3xx: Redirection
Message:	Description:
300 Multiple Choices	A link list. The user can select a link and go to that location. Maximum five addresses  
301 Moved Permanently	The requested page has moved to a new URL 
302 Found	The requested page has moved temporarily to a new URL 
303 See Other	The requested page can be found under a different URL
304 Not Modified	Indicates the requested page has not been modified since last requested
307 Temporary Redirect	The requested page has moved temporarily to a new URL
308 Permanent Redirect	The requested page has moved permanently to a new URL


4xx: Client Error
Message:	Description:
400 Bad Request	The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax
401 Unauthorized	The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond to it. For use when authentication is possible but has failed or not yet been provided
402 Payment Required	Reserved for future use
403 Forbidden	The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond to it
404 Not Found	The requested page could not be found but may be available again in the future
405 Method Not Allowed	A request was made of a page using a request method not supported by that page
406 Not Acceptable	The server can only generate a response that is not accepted by the client
407 Proxy Authentication Required	The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy
408 Request Timeout	The server timed out waiting for the request
409 Conflict	The request could not be completed because of a conflict in the request
410 Gone	The requested page is no longer available
411 Length Required	The "Content-Length" is not defined. The server will not accept the request without it 
412 Precondition Failed	The precondition given in the request evaluated to false by the server
413 Request Too Large	The server will not accept the request, because the request entity is too large
414 Request-URI Too Long	The server will not accept the request, because the URI is too long. Occurs when you convert a POST request to a GET request with a long query information 
415 Unsupported Media Type	The server will not accept the request, because the media type is not supported 
416 Range Not Satisfiable	The client has asked for a portion of the file, but the server cannot supply that portion
417 Expectation Failed	The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field

5xx: Server Error
Message:	Description:
500 Internal Server Error	A generic error message, given when no more specific message is suitable
501 Not Implemented	The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request
502 Bad Gateway	The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server
503 Service Unavailable	The server is currently unavailable (overloaded or down)
504 Gateway Timeout	The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server
505 HTTP Version Not Supported	The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request
511 Network Authentication Required	The client needs to authenticate to gain network access



The onreadystatechange Property
The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.

The onreadystatechange property defines a callback function to be executed when the readyState changes.

The status property and the statusText properties hold the status of the XMLHttpRequest object.

Property	Description
onreadystatechange	Defines a function to be called when the readyState property changes
readyState	Holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.
0: request not initialized
1: server connection established
2: request received
3: processing request
4: request finished and response is ready
status	200: "OK"
403: "Forbidden"
404: "Page not found"
For a complete list go to the Http Messages Reference
statusText	Returns the status-text (e.g. "OK" or "Not Found")
The onreadystatechange function is called every time the readyState changes.

When readyState is 4 and status is 200, the response is ready:

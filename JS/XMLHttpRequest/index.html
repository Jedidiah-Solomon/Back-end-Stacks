      <h3>XMLHttpRequest</h3>
      <p>
        XMLHttpRequest is an API provided by web browsers that allows JavaScript
        to make HTTP requests to servers. It is the foundational technology
        behind AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and is commonly used to
        fetch data from a server asynchronously without needing to reload the
        entire web page. XML (Extensible Markup Language). Key features and
        usage of XMLHttpRequest include: Asynchronous Operations: The requests
        made with XMLHttpRequest are asynchronous by default. This means that
        JavaScript execution will continue while the request is being processed,
        and a callback function is used to handle the response when it arrives.
        Cross-Origin Requests: XMLHttpRequest supports making requests to
        domains other than the one hosting the current web page (cross-origin
        requests). However, this is subject to the same-origin policy, which
        restricts certain actions due to security considerations. HTTP Methods:
        It supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.,
        allowing developers to perform different types of operations on a
        server. Handling Responses: Responses from the server can be retrieved
        in different formats like text, JSON, XML, etc. The response can be
        processed in the callback function defined for XMLHttpRequest.
        Event-Driven API: XMLHttpRequest uses event listeners to monitor the
        progress of requests (e.g., onload, onreadystatechange, onerror, etc.).

      <h3>Uses of XMLHttpRequest</h3>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Update a web page without reloading the page</li>
          <li>Request data from a server - after the page has loaded</li>
          <li>Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded</li>
          <li>Data to a server - in the background</li>

    <div class="details">
      id,name/first,name/last,rating/0,rating/1,rating/2 1,Dan,Jones,8,7,9
      2,Bill,Barner,7,6,5 3,Joe,Smoe,4,3, it sees id as one, name as an object
      with two properties of firsta and last, rating as an aray with three
      values Input Records- Header: true Header Fields: 6 Data: Separator: ,
      Fields: 6 Records: 3

      <p>Hobbies: ${user.hobbies.join(', ')}</p>
      or do the same but 2nd allows us to choose array values we want while
      first makes it simple to write at once
      <p>Hobbies: ${user.hobbies[0]}, ${user.hobbies[1]}, ${user.hobbies[2]}</p>

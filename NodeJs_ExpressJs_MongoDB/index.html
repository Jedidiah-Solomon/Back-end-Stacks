            fs.readFile("index.html", ...): This function reads the contents of index.html.

            http.createServer((req, res) => {...}): This function creates an
            HTTP server. The callback function is executed each time the server
            receives a request. req: The request object, representing the
            incoming request. res: The response object, representing the
            server's response to the request. Inside the callback function:
            res.statusCode = 200;: Sets the HTTP status code of the response to
            200 (OK). res.setHeader("Content-type", "text/html");: Sets the
            Content-type header of the response to text/html, indicating that
            the content being sent is HTML. res.write(html);: Writes the HTML
            content (read from the index.html file) to the response. res.end();:
            Ends the response. server.listen(port, hostname, () => {...}): This
            function starts the server, making it listen for requests on the
            specified hostname and port. The callback function logs a message to
            the console indicating that the server has started successfully.
            Starting the Server: server.listen(port, hostname, callback) starts
            the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port
            and hostname. Note: Console Tab: The "Console" tab will show any
            JavaScript errors or logs from your client-side code (HTML,
            JavaScript). But the http codes are diplayed inside the browser

            nodemon, which will automatically restart the server when you make
            changes to your files.

            Using browser-sync for automatic browser reload browser-sync can be
            used in conjunction with nodemon to reload the browser
            automatically. Then create a config file for it: bs-config.js. This
            configuration tells browser-sync to proxy your server running on
            localhost:3005 and watch for changes in HTML, CSS, JS, and image
            files. It will serve the site on port 4000.

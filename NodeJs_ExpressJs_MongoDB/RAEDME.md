# Node js

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.

Why Node.js?
Node.js uses asynchronous programming!

A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:

Sends the task to the computer's file system.
Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
Returns the content to the client.
Ready to handle the next request.
Here is how Node.js handles a file request:

Sends the task to the computer's file system.
Ready to handle the next request.
When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.

What Can Node.js Do?
Node.js can generate dynamic page content
Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
Node.js can collect form data
Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database
What is a Node.js File?
Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
Node.js files have extension ".js"

## Express.js

Express.js, also called "Express," is a minimalist, fast Node.js backend framework. The software is open-source and is released under the MIT license.

Here are some steps and concepts you can focus on to dive deeper into Express.js:

Routing: Learn how to set up routes in Express to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URL paths.
Middleware: Understand how middleware functions work in Express and how they can be used for tasks like logging, error handling, authentication, and more.
Working with Requests and Responses: Learn how to handle request parameters, query strings, request bodies, and headers. Explore different ways to send responses back to clients.
Database Integration: Explore using databases like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL with Express.js. Learn about ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) like Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for SQL databases).
Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization using packages like Passport.js or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Express.
Error Handling: Implement error handling middleware to gracefully manage errors in your application.
API Development: Focus on creating RESTful APIs with Express.js to serve data to client-side applications.
Security: Learn about security best practices in Express.js, such as sanitizing inputs, preventing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, and implementing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
Testing: Explore testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, or Jest to write unit tests for your Express.js applications.
Deployment: Learn how to deploy your Express.js applications to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

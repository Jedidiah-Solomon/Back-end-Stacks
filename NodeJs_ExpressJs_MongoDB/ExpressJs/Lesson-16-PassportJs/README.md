# Passport Js

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more

The use of `app.delete("/logout", ...)` in the server code and `method="POST"` in the HTML form with the `_method=DELETE` query parameter is to implement method overriding. This allows a form to send a DELETE request, which is not natively supported by HTML forms (they only support GET and POST methods). Method overriding is a common practice to adhere to RESTful conventions where certain actions like DELETE are used for specific purposes, such as logging out a user.

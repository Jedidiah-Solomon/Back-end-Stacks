        align-items:

This property is used on the flex container (the parent element with display: flex) to align flex items along the cross-axis.
It aligns flex items vertically when the flex direction is row, and horizontally when the flex direction is column.
Common values for align-items include:
flex-start: Aligns items to the start of the cross-axis.
flex-end: Aligns items to the end of the cross-axis.
center: Aligns items to the center of the cross-axis.
stretch: Stretches items to fill the cross-axis.
baseline: Aligns items to their baselines.
align-content:

This property is used on the flex container to align lines of flex items along the cross-axis.
It only has an effect when there is more than one line of flex items (i.e., when flex-wrap is set to wrap or wrap-reverse).
Common values for align-content include:
flex-start: Aligns lines of flex items to the start of the cross-axis.
flex-end: Aligns lines of flex items to the end of the cross-axis.
center: Aligns lines of flex items to the center of the cross-axis.
space-between: Distributes lines of flex items evenly, with the first line at the start and the last line at the end.
space-around: Distributes lines of flex items evenly with equal space around them.
In summary, align-items is used to align individual flex items within their flex container along the cross-axis, while align-content is used to align lines of flex items within the flex container when there are multiple lines.
